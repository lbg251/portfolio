# Lauren Greenspan 

As a doctoral graduate with a background in high energy physics and extensive experience in research, teaching, and writing, I am seeking to apply my analytical, computational, and project management skills in the field of Machine Learning. My proficiency in Python and experience with generative models, combined with a passion for AI safety and excellent communication skills, position me to make meaningful contributions to cutting-edge ML projects.

#### Technical Skills: Python, Mathematica, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, PyTorch, Git, Jupyter, tableau, SQL

## Education
- Ph.D., Physics | University of Porto (_May 2017_)								       		
- M.S., Physics	| Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics/ University of Waterloo (_June 2012_)	 			        		
- B.A., Individualized Study | New York University (_May 2009_)


## Work Experience
**Machine Learning and AI Safety Researcher (_June 2022 - October 2023_)**
- Conducted independent research in NLP and the mechanistic interpretability of transformer models, funded by a grant from the Center for Effective Altruism's long-term future fund.
- Discovered a novel toy model to understand attention-head superposition, published on the Alignment Forum and cited by teams at Anthropic and DeepMind.

**Summer Postdoctoral Researcher, New York University (_June 2021 - September 2021_)**
- Analyzed jet tree data generated by novel probabilistic algorithms, advised by Kyle Cranmer
- Studied the effectiveness of these models for use in jet classification, with results presented at NeurIPS.

**Adjunct Professor and Academic Advisor, New York University (_September 2017 - May 2021_)**
- Developed and taught undergraduate seminars on a variety of interdisciplinary topics.
- Advised students through their academic careers, including course planning, research projects, and grant proposals.
